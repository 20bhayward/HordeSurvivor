# Class Design: The Prince

## Overview

**Theme:** Human King, Commander, Hope of Humanity, Strategic Leader, Hero Unit.
**Playstyle Focus:** Leading a disciplined army of human soldiers, finding and recruiting survivors, issuing commands to generals, and fighting on the front lines as a powerful hero.
**Unique Mechanic:** Kingdom Management (Idle Game) & General Command System.
**Primary Resource:** Gold (for recruitment & kingdom upgrades), Survivors (for new soldier types & kingdom growth).

## Core Abilities & Gameplay Loop

### 1. Army Recruitment & Composition:
* **Base Units:** Starts with basic Militia or Guardsmen.
* **Finding Survivors:** Special events or locations on the mini-open-world floor allow the Prince to rescue or recruit survivors.
* **Unlocking Soldier Types:** Survivors, combined with research in the Kingdom Management minigame, unlock new soldier types (e.g., Archers, Spearmen, Crossbowmen, Knights, Battle Mages, Medics).
* **Recruitment:** Spend Gold at "Barracks" points of interest or through the Kingdom interface to reinforce the army up to an "Army Capacity."

### 2. The Prince as a Hero Unit:
* The Prince is a powerful unit on the battlefield, directly participating in combat.
* **Combat Styles (Evolvable):**
    * *Warlord:* Focus on melee prowess, durability, and inspiring nearby troops (AoE buffs).
    * *Tactician:* Focus on ranged attacks (bow/crossbow) and battlefield control abilities.
    * *Paladin:* Focus on holy magic for smiting foes and healing/protecting allies.
* Gains levels and can equip unique "Royal Arms" or "Artifacts."

### 3. Generals & Commands:
* Unlock and assign "Generals" (up to a limit). Generals are not typically individual units on the field but provide:
    * **Passive Army Buffs:** Increased damage for archers, better armor for infantry, faster medics, etc.
    * **Active "Commands":** Powerful, cooldown-based abilities the Prince can trigger during combat. Examples:
        * `Volley Fire!`: All ranged units focus fire on a target area with increased rate of fire.
        * `Shield Wall!`: Infantry units gain a temporary massive defense bonus and taunt.
        * `Charge!`: Melee units gain a burst of speed and damage.
        * `Healing Ward`: Deploy a temporary healing zone.
        * `Reinforcements!`: Instantly summon a small squad of basic units.
* Generals can be leveled up or upgraded through the Kingdom Management minigame.

### 4. Survivor Management:
* Rescued survivors contribute to the Kingdom's population.
* Population is a resource for unlocking new technologies, buildings, or soldier types in the idle game.

## Minigame: Idle Kingdom Management

* **Interface:** Accessible via a dedicated screen, potentially viewable during lulls in exploration or between floors.
* **Mechanics:**
    * **Assign Survivors:** Allocate survivors to tasks:
        * *Farming:* Generates Food (upkeep or growth).
        * *Logging/Mining:* Generates Resources (for building/upgrades).
        * *Research:* Unlocks new soldier types, general abilities, kingdom upgrades, or Prince abilities.
        * *Training:* Improves the base stats of newly recruited soldiers.
    * **Construct Buildings:** Barracks (faster recruitment), Blacksmith (equipment upgrades), Mage Tower (magic research/units), Walls (passive kingdom defense score influencing certain events).
    * **Progression:** Buildings and research take time (can be tied to in-game actions like clearing encounters, or simplified real-time).
* **Output:** Provides Gold, unlocks new soldier types, enhances existing units, unlocks new General Commands, and provides passive benefits for the Prince's main campaign.

## Progression & Evolution

* **Stronger Army:** Soldiers gain better stats, improved equipment, and specialized roles.
* **Advanced Soldier Types:** Access to more powerful and diverse human units.
* **More Effective Generals:** Generals provide better passive buffs and more potent commands.
* **Prince's Prowess:** The Prince becomes a more formidable hero with enhanced combat skills, new abilities, and better equipment.
* **Kingdom Prosperity:** A thriving kingdom provides more resources and faster unlocks.
* **Larger Army Capacity:** Ability to command a larger and more imposing force.

## Visual Theme & Tone

* Hopeful, organized, medieval fantasy with a touch of renaissance.
* Soldiers are well-equipped, with distinct visual differences between unit types.
* The Prince is charismatic and heroic, with armor and weaponry reflecting their chosen combat style.
* Kingdom interface is functional but can show visual progression (small village to bustling town).
* Spell effects (if Paladin path) are bright, holy, and protective. Command effects are clear visual cues (banners, rallying cries).
