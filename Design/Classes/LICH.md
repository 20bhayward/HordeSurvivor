# Class Design: The Lich

## Overview

**Theme:** Master of Undeath, Necromancer, Collector of Souls, Strategic Army Builder.
**Playstyle Focus:** Raising and commanding an ever-growing army of undead minions. Indirect damage through minions, strategic unit composition, and powerful death-themed spells. Evolves to command stronger, smarter, and more diverse undead.
**Unique Mechanic:** Undead Fusion & Minion Evolution.
**Primary Resource:** Souls (for spells & temporary summons), Corpses (for permanent minion upgrades/fusion).

## Core Abilities & Gameplay Loop

### 1. Raising Undead:
* **Basic Summons:** Lich can expend Souls to temporarily raise basic Skeletons or Zombies from ambient energy/minor corpses during combat encounters. These are numerous but weaker.
* **Corpse Collection:** Defeated enemies (especially humanoids or specific creature types) leave behind usable "Corpses" as a persistent resource collected during a floor.
* **Graveyards/Necropolis:** Specific points of interest on the mini-open-world floor where the Lich can perform more permanent necromantic rituals using collected Corpses.

### 2. Minion Types & Evolution:
* **Initial Undead:**
    * *Skeletal Warriors:* Basic melee attackers.
    * *Skeletal Archers:* Basic ranged attackers.
    * *Bloated Zombies:* Slow, durable, may explode on death.
* **Evolution Path (via Minigame - Undead Fusion):**
    * Collect different "qualities" or "types" of Corpses and Soul Essences.
    * Fuse these components to upgrade existing undead types (e.g., Skeletal Warrior -> Armored Skeleton -> Death Knight) or create entirely new, specialized units (e.g., Skeletal Mage, Bone Golem, Banshee, Necrotic Abomination).
    * Discover "recipes" or experiment with combinations.
    * Evolved undead become part of the Lich's permanent retinue for the current run, summonable at a higher Soul cost or limited by a "Command Cap."

### 3. Chosen Undead Guards:
* The Lich can designate a few powerful, evolved undead as "Champions" or "Lieutenants."
* These guards are always active (don't need to be resummoned unless destroyed in a run) and may have unique abilities or provide buffs to nearby lesser undead.
* They can be customized or equipped with "Necromantic Artifacts" found or crafted.

### 4. Spells & Damage Focus:
* While minions are primary, the Lich has access to spells:
    * **Debuffs:** `Curse of Weakness` (enemies deal less damage), `Decrepify` (slows enemies, increases damage taken).
    * **Direct Damage (Death Magic):** `Soul Siphon` (channeled beam, heals Lich), `Corpse Explosion` (detonates corpses for AoE damage), `Death Coil` (single target nuke or heal for undead).
    * **Utility/Army Augmentation:** `Unholy Frenzy` (temporary attack speed buff for undead), `Call of the Grave` (mass temporary summon).
* **Damage Focus Possibilities (Upgrade Paths):**
    * *Overwhelming Numbers:* Focus on buffing quantity and basic stats of many cheap undead.
    * *Elite Guard:* Focus on empowering a few very powerful Champions.
    * *Spell Lich:* Focus on enhancing personal spell damage and utility, using undead more as a defensive screen.

## Minigame: Undead Fusion & Combo Creation

* **Location:** Accessed at Graveyards on the map or a dedicated "Necropolis" screen (between combats or floors).
* **Mechanics:**
    * Interface showing collected Corpse Types (e.g., Humanoid Warrior Corpse, Beast Corpse, Magical Creature Corpse) and Essences (e.g., Essence of Speed, Essence of Frost, Potent Soul Remnant).
    * Select base undead + corpses + essences to attempt fusion.
    * Success can result in:
        * Upgraded version of the base undead (e.g., Skeleton -> Burning Skeleton).
        * A new, distinct undead type.
        * Failed fusions might consume resources or produce a hostile "Failed Experiment."
    * Recipes can be discovered through experimentation or found as loot/rewards.
* **Goal:** Unlock a diverse roster of powerful undead to customize the army composition. Create synergistic undead units (e.g., a unit that debuffs enemies, making them vulnerable to another unit's damage type).

## Progression & Evolution

* **Stronger Undead:** Minions gain better stats, new abilities (cleave, ranged pierce, AoE auras).
* **Smarter Undead:** Improved AI for minions (better targeting, defensive maneuvers, ability usage).
* **More Unit Types:** Unlocking diverse undead through the fusion minigame.
* **Spell Enhancement:** Spells become more potent, gain new effects, or reduce cooldowns.
* **Increased Command Cap:** Ability to control more or more powerful undead simultaneously.
* **Lich's Personal Power:** Lich may gain passive buffs, improved resource generation, or new spell schools.

## Visual Theme & Tone

* Dark, gothic, ethereal.
* Undead designs range from classic skeletons and zombies to more grotesque and powerful abominations.
* Spell effects are shadowy, soul-infused, or bone-themed.
* The Lich themself becomes more imposing and adorned with symbols of death and power as they evolve.
