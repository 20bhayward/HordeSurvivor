# Class Design: The Void Spawn

## Overview

**Theme:** Alien Entity, Eldritch Horror, Constant Evolution, Apex Predator, Lone Survivor.
**Playstyle Focus:** Plays completely alone, without an army. Focuses on its own rapid evolution by consuming enemies and absorbing their traits. Adapts its form and abilities to overcome challenges, culminating in one of several powerful final forms.
**Unique Mechanic:** Adaptive Evolution (consuming specific enemies/materials to guide mutation) & Hunt Targets.
**Primary Resource:** Biomass (general XP for evolution), Genetic Markers (specific materials for targeted evolution paths).

## Core Abilities & Gameplay Loop

### 1. Plays Alone:
* The Void Spawn does not summon minions or recruit allies. All power is concentrated in itself.
* This means its base stats, abilities, and survivability must scale significantly higher than other classes' individual leaders.

### 2. Consumption & Adaptation:
* **Biomass:** Generic resource gained from defeating any enemy. Used to fuel general stat increases or unlock basic evolutionary tiers.
* **Genetic Markers:** Specific resources dropped by certain enemy types, elites, or bosses (e.g., "Armored Carapace," "Venomous Gland," "Psionic Neuron," "Shadowy Essence"). These are used to steer evolution towards specific traits or final forms.
* **Absorb Trait (Conceptual):** Certain powerful "Hunt" targets, when defeated, might unlock a unique ability or significant mutation directly inspired by that creature.

### 3. Evolutionary Paths (Minigame Focus):
* The core of Void Spawn gameplay is its evolution tree. Accessed via a dedicated screen.
* Players spend Biomass and Genetic Markers to unlock nodes on the tree.
* Nodes can grant:
    * Stat increases (Health, Damage, Speed, Armor, Regeneration).
    * New active abilities (e.g., Void Lash, Devouring Maw, Phase Shift, Psionic Blast).
    * Passive traits (e.g., Spiked Hide, Acidic Blood, Adaptive Camouflage, Enhanced Senses).
    * Modifications to existing abilities (e.g., Void Lash now cleaves, Devouring Maw heals more).
* The tree branches significantly, leading towards one of three ultimate evolutions. Choices made early can influence or lock pathways to later forms.

### 4. Ultimate Evolutions (Final Forms):

* **A. Hive Lord (Swarm Path):**
    * **Focus:** Area denial, damage over time, spawning temporary, lesser void creatures (not permanent minions, but rather part of its abilities, e.g., "spawn exploding mites on hit," "create a carpet of void creep that damages enemies").
    * **Abilities:** Voidling Swarm, Creeping Doom, Pestilent Breath, Hive Mind (passively buffs temporary spawns).
    * **Visuals:** More insectoid or multi-limbed, perhaps with pulsating sacs or orifices from which smaller creatures emerge.

* **B. World Eater (Size/Brute Path):**
    * **Focus:** Immense size, overwhelming physical power, high durability, consuming enemies to restore health/gain temporary buffs.
    * **Abilities:** Titanic Slam, Devour Whole (instant kill small enemies, damage/debuff large ones), Unstoppable Charge, Void Quake.
    * **Visuals:** Becomes colossal, with thick plating, massive claws or tentacles, a gaping maw. Its movements cause screen shake.

* **C. Void Apex (Combat/Style Path):**
    * **Focus:** High agility, potent single-target damage, complex ability combos, stealth, precision strikes, hit-and-run tactics.
    * **Abilities:** Void Blink Strike, Dimensional Rift (teleport/dodge), Executioner's Mark, Shadow Rend, Perfect Form (temporary invulnerability and damage boost).
    * **Visuals:** Sleek, terrifyingly graceful, perhaps with shifting shadows, multiple eyes, or energy blades. More "assassin" or "duelist" eldritch horror.

### 5. Hunt Powerful Creatures:
* Specific, powerful "Alpha" creatures or mini-bosses are marked on the mini-open-world map as "Hunt Targets."
* Defeating these provides significant Biomass, rare Genetic Markers crucial for advanced evolutions, and sometimes unique trait unlocks.
* These hunts serve as major progression milestones within a floor.

## Minigame: Evolutionary Path & Material Consumption

* **Interface:** An "Evolution Chamber" or "Void Infusion" screen. Visually represented as a branching tree or a morphing biological diagram.
* **Mechanics:**
    * Nodes on the tree display their cost (Biomass, specific Genetic Markers) and the benefit they provide.
    * Players choose which nodes to unlock, shaping their current build.
    * Certain branches might require specific combinations of Genetic Markers, encouraging targeted hunting.
    * Reaching a "Keystone" node might trigger a significant morphological change or unlock a new core ability.
* **Goal:** Guide the Void Spawn's evolution towards a desired playstyle or one of the ultimate forms, adapting to the challenges faced.

## Progression & Evolution

* **Constant Transformation:** The Void Spawn's appearance and abilities are constantly changing throughout a run.
* **Specialization:** Choices in the evolution tree lead to distinct builds even before reaching a final form.
* **Synergistic Abilities:** Unlocking abilities and passives that work well together is key to maximizing effectiveness.
* **Increased Power Curve:** The Void Spawn should feel like it's rapidly growing in power, especially after successful hunts or major evolutionary steps.

## Visual Theme & Tone

* Eldritch, alien, cosmic horror, bio-mechanical, constantly shifting.
* Starts as a relatively simple or amorphous void creature.
* Evolutions are visually distinct and impactful. Limbs might change, new appendages grow, skin texture alters, energy patterns shift.
* Final forms are awe-inspiring and terrifying, truly embodying their chosen path (swarming horror, colossal behemoth, or sleek apex predator).
* Ability effects are void-themed: dark energy, spatial distortions, consuming tendrils, psionic energies.
