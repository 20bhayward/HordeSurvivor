# Class Design: The Beast Lord

## Overview

**Theme:** Primal Shaman, Master of Beasts, Shapeshifter, Nature's Wrath.
**Playstyle Focus:** Taming wild creatures to form a diverse pack, fighting alongside them, shapeshifting into powerful animal forms, and using shamanic magic/shouts to augment the pack and control the battlefield.
**Unique Mechanic:** Beast Taming & Breeding, Shamanic Tattoo Carving (Tetris-style inventory).
**Primary Resource:** Primal Essence (for taming, shouts, shapeshifting), Tamed Beasts (the army itself).

## Core Abilities & Gameplay Loop

### 1. Beast Taming:
* **Targeting Beasts:** Certain enemy "Beast" or "Monster" type units on the map are marked as "Tamable."
* **Taming Process:** Reduce the beast's health to a certain threshold, then use a "Tame Beast" ability (consumes Primal Essence and potentially a "Lure" item). Success chance may depend on the beast's remaining health, type, and Beast Lord's Taming skill.
* **Pack Limit:** The Beast Lord can control a certain number of tamed beasts at a time, based on their "Dominance" stat. Excess tamed beasts can be sent to a "Menagerie" (accessible via the minigame interface).

### 2. Shapeshifting:
* The Beast Lord can shapeshift into a few distinct animal forms, each offering a different playstyle focus for themselves. Forms are unlocked and upgraded through progression.
* **Forms:**
    * *Dire Wolf Form:* Focus on speed, single-target DPS, and pack flanking maneuvers. May grant buffs to canine beasts in the pack.
    * *Great Bear Form:* Focus on tanking, AoE taunts, and heavy melee attacks. May grant defensive buffs to sturdy beasts.
    * *Storm Roc Form (or similar avian):* Focus on ranged attacks (e.g., feather projectiles, gusts of wind), AoE, and mobility. May grant buffs to flying or ranged beasts.
    * *(Potential for more exotic forms later, e.g., Serpent Form for DoT/debuffs).*
* Shapeshifting costs Primal Essence and has a cooldown. Active form dictates the Beast Lord's personal attacks and some abilities.

### 3. Shouts & Shamanic Magic:
* The Beast Lord uses powerful "Shouts" or elemental shamanic spells:
    * **Augment Pack:** `Primal Rage` (AoE attack speed/damage buff for beasts), `Bestial Vigor` (AoE heal for beasts), `Stoneskin Pack` (AoE defense buff).
    * **Control/Debuff:** `Terrifying Roar` (AoE fear/stun), `Earthgrasp Totem` (summons totem to slow/root enemies), `Curse of the Wilds` (increases damage taken by enemies).
    * **Direct Damage:** `Lightning Claw` (melee elemental attack in human form), `Spirit Barrage` (ranged spirit projectiles).
* Shouts are augmented by the Shamanic Tattoo minigame.

### 4. Beast Army:
* The army consists of directly tamed creatures.
* Diversity is key: tanky beasts, ranged attackers, fast strikers, beasts with unique abilities (poison, web, stun).
* Beasts gain experience and can level up, improving their base stats. Some may even "evolve" or gain new traits upon leveling.

## Minigame: Beast Breeding & Shamanic Tattoos

### A. Beast Breeding:
* **Location:** "Lair" or "Menagerie" interface, accessible at safe zones or between floors.
* **Mechanics:**
    * Select two compatible tamed beasts from the Menagerie.
    * Consume "Primal Essence" or special food items.
    * Result: Potential for an offspring that inherits traits, stats, or abilities from parents. May also result in new hybrid abilities or improved base stats.
    * Chance for "mutations" leading to rare or stronger variants.
* **Goal:** Create superior beasts with desired ability combinations and improved stats, beyond what can be typically tamed in the wild.

### B. Shamanic Tattoos (Tetris-Style Inventory):
* **Collection:** "Tattoo Fragments" or "Sacred Carvings" are found as loot from elite beasts, bosses, or special events. These come in various shapes (like Tetris pieces or Path of Exile jewels).
* **Interface:** A grid representing the Beast Lord's skin or a shamanic totem.
* **Mechanics:**
    * Place collected Tattoo pieces onto the grid. Pieces cannot overlap.
    * Each piece provides a passive buff: e.g., +Beast Damage, +Shapeshift Duration, +Shout Effectiveness, +Taming Chance, specific elemental resistances for the pack.
    * Synergies: Placing certain tattoos adjacent to each other or in specific configurations might unlock bonus effects or activate "meta-tattoos."
* **Goal:** Strategically fit as many beneficial tattoos as possible, optimizing buffs for the current pack composition and playstyle.

## Progression & Evolution

* **Stronger Beasts:** Tamed and bred creatures become more powerful.
* **More Beast Types:** Access to taming and breeding a wider variety of creatures.
* **New Shapeshift Forms/Upgrades:** Unlock new forms or enhance existing ones with new abilities and passives.
* **Potent Shouts/Magic:** Shouts and spells become more impactful, affecting larger areas or having stronger effects.
* **Increased Dominance:** Ability to control more or more powerful beasts.
* **Tattoo Synergy:** A more optimized and powerful tattoo layout.

## Visual Theme & Tone

* Primal, wild, nature-infused, shamanistic.
* Beast designs are varied, from realistic animals to more fantastical monsters.
* The Beast Lord's appearance changes significantly with shapeshifting. In human form, they are adorned with furs, bones, totems, and glowing tattoos.
* Shouts have strong visual and auditory impact. Tattoos might manifest as faint glowing patterns on the Beast Lord or their active shapeshift form.
