* **New Team Members:** Start here to get a comprehensive understanding of the game.
* **During Development:** Refer to these documents regularly to ensure features are implemented as intended.
* **Design Discussions:** Use these documents as a basis for discussions about new features or changes to existing ones.
* **Updating Documents:** Design is iterative. When changes are made and agreed upon, the relevant documents in this folder **must be updated** to reflect the current state of the design. Assign ownership or a process for keeping these up-to-date.
